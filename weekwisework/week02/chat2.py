examples: 
Input : "what is 10 + 2 -3"
Output : "The answer is 5 It is calculated by following bodmas first 10 and 2 are added and 3 is subtracted from result .The level of query was EASY"

Input : "what is 5*sin(60) - 2 *cos(60)"
Output : "The answer is 3.8301 evaluate the trigonometric functions (in degrees) sin(60°) ≈ 0.8660 and cos(60°) ≈ 0.5 Now compute 5 × 0.8660 = 4.3301 2 × 0.5 = 1.0 Then subtract: 4.3301 - 1.0 = 3.3301 . The level of query was MEDIUM"
